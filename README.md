# FunFiles
A bunch of short files that I made whilst learning to program at school.
These were mostly made in Python.

We had weekly coding challenges and these helped me to get to grips with basic programming constructs.

The files I have uploaded is a mix of files made from the Year 9 at school all the way to A-Level!

Ignore the horrible versioning, nomenclature and terrible methods I used back then, I had to do learn the hard way not what to do so that I can now do things the right way today!
